# Convector CLI

Convector CLI is the official Command-Line Interface for <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/convector/" target="_blank">Convector Framework</a>. It is an open source project under an Apache 2.0 license to help you create Convector projects easily.

## Important

Recently malicious code was found in `event-stream` which is a dependency for `ps-tree` which is a dependency for `npm-run-all`, used in autogenerated projects created by `convector-cli` we took care of it and encourage people to upgrade their `@worldsibu/convector-cli` installation as soon as possible.

To upgrade:
```bash
npm update -g @worldsibu/convector-cli
```

[Details on the incident.](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116)

## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8.11.0 (other versions might work, but this is the one we use for development)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* You may want to install [Hurley](https://github.com/worldsibu/hurley) to manage your development environment as well. If it's not installed you can still create and manage your development environment through the NPM commands Convector-CLI generates for you.

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g @worldsibu/convector-cli
```

### Creating a new project with a chaincode ready

```bash
conv new PROJECT-NAME -c CHAINCODE-NAME
cd PROJECT-NAME
npm i
# Bring up a development blockchain in your computer
npm run env:restart
# Install the chaincode to the blockchain
npm run cc:start -- CHAINCODE-NAME 1
# Upgrade the code amazing code you build on top of the template
npm run cc:upgrade -- CHAINCODE-NAME 2
```

## Details

### conv new

The way to kickoff a new project. It includes the posibility to create a new project along a new Chaincode right out of the box. `npm i` and get a project working for you.

```bash
# New project
conv new <project-name> [-c -chaincode <chaincode-name>]
```

### conv generate

The easiest way to include new chaincodes, and model and controller files.

```bash
# Creates a chaincode package with a `model` and `controller` default. This needs to be run inside a Convector project folder.
conv generate chaincode <chaincode-name>
``` 

```bash
# Creates the file in the current folder (by overriding the folder conventions).
conv generate model <chaincode-name> <model-name>
```

## Tests 👷‍♂️

Fork Convector CLI repo, build it, link it to your global `node_modules`, and  use it.

1. First bring up all the source code dependencies by running `npm i`.
2. Then run `npm link` to enable it globally.

## Roadmap 🗺

Proposed current roadmap. Have ideas? Post them in the [Issues section](https://github.com/worldsibu/convector-cli/issues).

1. Individual generators for:
    1. Project root structure - `conv new`
    2. Package structure - `conv new -c <chaincode>` `conv generate`
    3. Model file - `conv generate model <model-name>`
    4. Controller file - `conv generate controller <controller-name>` [DEPRECATED]
    5. Convector Tool: Dev Env and Chaincode Manager - `npm run env:restart` `npm run cc:start -- <chaincode-name> <version>`
2. Log usage information to internet.
3. [🤚 We are here] Unify other Convector CLIs into one.
4. Test methods generation from controller.
5. Error collection details - report.
6. Versioning of cc creation, distribute different versions of dependencies.
7. Download settings from the internet.
